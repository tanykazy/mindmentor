# Mindmentor: Your AI Learning Companion

**AI Coach refines your knowledge with conversations and concept maps.**

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.3.8.

## Description

Mindmentor is an AI-powered conversational learning app designed for teenagers that can also be integrated into the classroom by teachers. It guides users through a structured dialogue to deepen their understanding of a specific topic. Using the advanced language understanding and reasoning capabilities of the Gemini API, Mindmentor analyzes the conversation to identify key concepts and their relationships. It then dynamically generates a concept map in Markdown format that visually represents the user's evolving understanding.

The app acts as a virtual mentor, asking insightful questions, challenging assumptions, and encouraging critical thinking. The conversation is tailored to each user's knowledge level, making learning engaging and personalized. The concept map serves as a visual aid to help users synthesize information, identify gaps in their knowledge, and make connections between different concepts.
